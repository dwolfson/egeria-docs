## Release 5.3 (March 2025)

_**These are DRAFT release notes.  The notes will be updated until & when 5.3 is released**_

??? functional "Open Metadata Types"
    * The [ExternalId](/types/0017-External-Identifiers) entity has a new attribute called *externalInstanceTypeName* to allow the capture of the type name of an instance from a third party system.
    * A new entity type called [*SolutionActorRole*](/types/7/0730-Solution-Components) allows new roles that interact with a solution to be modelled.
    * A new relationship called [*SolutionComponentActor*](/types/7/0730-Solution-Components) allows the [*Actors*](/types/1/0110-Actors) using a solution component to be identified.
    * The [*SolutionComponent*](/types/7/0730-Solution-Components) entity has a new attribute called *solutionComponentType* to allow the solution architect to distinguish between different types of components.
    * The [*InformationSupplyChain*](/types/7/0720-Information-Supply-Chains) relationship has a new attribute called *label* for use in lineage graphs.
    * The [*SolutionLinkingWire*](/types/7/0735-Solution-Posts-and-Wires) relationship has new attributes *label* and *description* for use in lineage graphs.
    * The [*FileSystem*](/types/0/0056-Resource-Managers) classification has new attributes *canonicalMountPoint* and *actualMountPoint* for normalizing file path names in a heterogeneous open metadata ecosystem.
    * A new relationship called [*DataMapping*](/types/7/0770-Lineage-Mapping) provides a dedicated relationship for fine-grained (column-level) lineage.
    * Types *GovernanceDomainDefinition*, *GovernanceDomainSet*, *GovernanceClassificationLevel*, *GovernanceClassificationSet*, *GovernanceStatusSet* and *GovernanceStatusLevel* have been deprecated in favour of using standard valid metadata values.

??? functional "New View Service: Solution Architect OMVS"
    [Solution Architect OMVS](/services/omvs/solution-architect/overview) supports the management and querying of [Information Supply Chains](/concepts/information-supply-chain) and [solution components](/concepts/solution-component).

??? functional "New View Service: Classification Explorer OMVS"
    [Classification Explorer OMVS](/services/omvs/classification-explorer/overview) supports enables the caller to issue queries to understand how metadata elements are linked and classified.

??? functional "New View Service: Governance Officer OMVS"
    [Governance Officer OMVS](/services/omvs/governance-officer/overview) supports the maintenance of the metadata for a governance domain.

??? functional "New View Service: Notification Manager OMVS"
    [Notification Manager OMVS](/services/omvs/notification-manager/overview) supports the management and querying of [ToDos](/concepts/to-do) and [IncidentReports](/concepts/incident-report).

??? functional "New View Service: Data Discovery OMVS"
    [Data Discovery OMVS](/services/omvs/data-discovery/overview) supports the creation of data specs and saved searches.

??? functional "New View Service: Reference Data OMVS"
    [Reference Data OMVS](/services/omvs/reference-data/overview) supports the query and maintenance of code values and reference data.

??? danger "Removal of deprecated types and attributes"
    As Egeria has developed over the years, the type system has also evolved.  This has meant that some of the original types have been deprecated in favour of new types.  At this point in time, none of the egeria code (either in the Java runtime, samples or python pyegeria libraries) and so this is a good time to slim down the type system by removing the deprecated types and attributes.  The following has been removed:
    
    * GovernanceDomainDescription
    * GovernanceDomainSet
    * GovernanceClassificationLevel
    * GovernanceClassificationSet    
    * GovernanceStatusSet
