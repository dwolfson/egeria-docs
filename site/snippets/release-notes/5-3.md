## Release 5.3 (April 2025)

_**These are DRAFT release notes.  The notes will be updated until & when 5.3 is released**_

??? functional "Open Metadata Types"
    * The [ExternalId](/types/0017-External-Identifiers) entity has a new attribute called *externalInstanceTypeName* to allow the capture of the type name of an instance from a third party system.
    * A new entity type called [*SolutionActorRole*](/types/7/0730-Solution-Components) allows new roles that interact with a solution to be modelled.
    * A new relationship called [*SolutionComponentActor*](/types/7/0730-Solution-Components) allows the [*Actors*](/types/1/0110-Actors) using a solution component to be identified.
    * The [*SolutionComponent*](/types/7/0730-Solution-Components) entity has a new attribute called *solutionComponentType* to allow the solution architect to distinguish between different types of components.
    * The [*InformationSupplyChain*](/types/7/0720-Information-Supply-Chains) relationship has a new attribute called *label* for use in lineage graphs.
    * The [*SolutionLinkingWire*](/types/7/0735-Solution-Posts-and-Wires) relationship has new attributes *label* and *description* for use in lineage graphs.
    * The [*FileSystem*](/types/0/0056-Resource-Managers) classification has new attributes *canonicalMountPoint* and *localMountPoint* for normalizing file path names in a heterogeneous open metadata ecosystem.
    * A new relationship called [*DataMapping*](/types/7/0770-Lineage-Mapping) provides a dedicated relationship for fine-grained (column-level) lineage.
    * Types *GovernanceDomainDefinition*, *GovernanceDomainSet*, *GovernanceClassificationLevel*, *GovernanceClassificationSet*, *GovernanceStatusSet* and *GovernanceStatusLevel* have been deprecated in favour of using standard valid metadata values.
    * New types for describing data dictionaries and data specifications are available in models [0580 Data Dictionaries](/types/5/0580-Data-Dictionaries) and [0581 Data Field Implementation](/types/5/0581-Data-Field-Implementation).
    * The [CommentType](/types/1/0150-Feedback) has a new valid value of "REQUIREMENT".
    * The [ProjectCharter](/types/4/0442-Project-Charter) entity now has a display name.

??? functional "Updated View Service: Project Manager OMVS"
    The Project Manager OMVS now has a new call to retrieve a project with its dependent projects, resources and assigned people.  This is supplied as nested JSON and also as a mermaid graph.

??? functional "New View Service: Solution Architect OMVS"
    [Solution Architect OMVS](/services/omvs/solution-architect/overview) supports the management and querying of [Information Supply Chains](/concepts/information-supply-chain) and [solution components](/concepts/solution-component).

??? functional "New View Service: Classification Explorer OMVS"
    [Classification Explorer OMVS](/services/omvs/classification-explorer/overview) supports enables the caller to issue queries to understand how metadata elements are linked and classified.

??? info "Increased resilience in error handling"

??? danger "Rename of Open Connector Framework Wrapper Beans"
    In order to distinguish the bean names used in the Open Connector Framework (OCF) from the beans used in the Open Metadata Framework (OMF), the Bean Wrapper classes of the OCF have been renamed as follows:

    * ConnectionProperties -> ConnectionDetails
    * ConnectorTypeProperties -> ConnectorTypeDetails
    * EndpointProperties -> EndpointDetails
    * EmbeddedConnectionProperties -> EmbeddedConnectionDetails
    * RelatedAssetProperties -> RelatedAssetDetails
    * ConnectedAssetProperties -> ConnectedAssetDetails
    * VirtualConnectionProperties -> VirtualConnectionDetails

??? danger "Removal of deprecated types and attributes"
    As Egeria has developed over the years, the type system has also evolved.  This has meant that some of the original types have been deprecated in favour of new types.  At this point in time, none of the egeria code (either in the Java runtime, samples or python pyegeria libraries) and so this is a good time to slim down the type system by removing the deprecated types and attributes.  The following has been removed:
    
    * GovernanceDomainDescription
    * GovernanceDomainSet
    * GovernanceClassificationLevel
    * GovernanceClassificationSet    
    * GovernanceStatusSet
