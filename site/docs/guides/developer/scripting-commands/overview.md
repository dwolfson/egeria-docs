# Scripting commands

The *pyegeria* command line services allow interaction with the open metadata and governance services of Egeria from a scripting language. The naming convention for the widgets helps to understand their behaviour. When the widget starts with:

* get - it will return details about a single item
* list - lists elements through a paging interface like "more" - use q to quit.
* view - provides a live view - typically of a status - use control-c to quit

## Installation
The **pyegeria** Egeria Python client can be installed from **pypi** . Python version 3.10 and above is a pre-requisite.
One common way to install Python packages is with the **pip** command. So to install **pyegeria** you can execute:

```shell
pip install pyegeria
```

This will install **pyegeria** and all of its required packages.

## Using

Once **pyegeria** is installed. The widgets may be invoked from a terminal window or shell either as a command or as a python script.
To start a widget as a command, just type its full name at the command prompt. For instance, typing:

```shell
view_platform_status.py
```

Will display a table showing the status of all running Egeria OMAG Server platforms.

Commands can also be invoked directly if you are in the same folder as the widget (or the widgets are on the python search path).

```shell
python3 view_platform_status.py
```

All of the widgets have optional command line arguments. You can see them by setting the `--h` help flag.

Most of the commands allow you to specify an Egeria OMAG Platform, Server (usually a view server), and user identity.  If not specified, default values will use the Egeria default configuration with:

* platform = "https://localhost:9443"
* server = "view-server"
* user id = a user, such as **erinoverview** from the fictitious [Coco Pharmaceuticals](https://egeria-project.org/practices/coco-pharmaceuticals/) environment.
