# Dojo Introduction

The Egeria "dojo" is an intensive course to help you learn about Egeria. It is designed as a 5-day effort, although, since it is self-study you can dip in and out of it as time permits.

The objectives of the five days are as follows:

- *Running Egeria* day: Learning about setting up and running Egeria.
- *Developer* day: Learning how to call Egeria's APIs and develop new connectors to integration third party technologies.
- *Metadata Governance* day: Learning how to improve the quality and expand the content of your metadata.
- *Egeria Contributor* day: Learning how to make a contribution to Egeria. Learning how to go on to become either an advocate or a maintainer.
- *Egeria in Production* day: Learning how to run Egeria in production with high availability and resilience.
