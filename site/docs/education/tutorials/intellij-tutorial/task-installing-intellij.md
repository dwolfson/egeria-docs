### Installing Intellij 

Link to the [download](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/) page and follow the instructions.

Start up IntelliJ and set up Maven to the version that you downloaded by selecting `Preferences ...` from the `File` menu and then `Build, Execution, Deployment` followed by `Build Tools` followed by `Maven` in the left-hand menu of the resulting wizard. Ensure the `Maven Home Directory` points to a level of Maven that is at least version `3.5.0`.
