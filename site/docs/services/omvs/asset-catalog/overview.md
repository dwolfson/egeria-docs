# Asset Catalog Open Metadata View Service (OMVS)

The Asset Catalog OMVS provides services to search for [data resources](/concepts/resource) including:

* data stores
* event feeds
* APIs
* data sets

The search locates data resources based on the content of the [asset](/concepts/asset) metadata itself and the metadata that links to it. This includes:

* glossary terms
* schema elements
* assets
* lineage

The Asset Catalog REST API supports:

* the retrieval of assets based on unique identifiers
* the retrieval of asset's relationships and classifications
* the query for related assets and lineage
* the retrieval of assets based on their type
* the retrieval of glossaries and their content
