# Egeria features

The Egeria features describe the value-add features that Egeria adds to its ability to synchronize metadata between different tools and catalogues.

- [Anchor Management](/features/anchor-management/overview) - grouping metadata elements into larger objects so that they can share a common lifecycle.
- [Cohort Operation](/features/cohort-operation/overview) - How does an open metadata repository cohort work.
- [Discovery and Stewardship](/features/discovery-and-stewardship/overview) - automated metadata discovery and stewardship of results.
- [Duplicate Management](/features/duplicate-management/overview) - linking metadata elements that represent the same [resource](/concepts/resource) so that these duplicates are automatically merged and do not bloat metadata query results.
- [Effectivity Dating](/features/effectivity-dates/overview) - adding an optional start and end date to metadata elements to limit *when* they can be returned on a metadata query.
- [External Identifiers](/features/external-identifiers/overview) - attaching the identifiers that metadata elements are known as in external tools and platforms to make it easier to match metadata from each system when synchronizing metadata.
- [External References](/features/external-references/overview) - enriching metadata elements with links to related external material.
- [Governance Zones](/features/governance-zoning/overview) - grouping [assets](/concepts/asset) that have similar uses and/or governance requirements into governance zones. The assets in a zone can be queried and managed as a group.
- [Incident Reporting](/features/incident-reporting/overview) - reporting and managing the actions associated with a detected incident or issue relating to a metadata element or associated [resource](/concepts/resource).
- [Integrated Cataloguing](/features/integrated-cataloguing/overview) - using automation to automatically synchronize metadata between Egeria and external tools and platforms.
- [Lineage Management](/features/lineage-management/overview) - Tracing the origin and uses of resources in the organization.
- [Metadata Archiving](/features/metadata-archiving/overview) - capturing and storing metadata into archives for backups, to share standard definitions between organizations or independently deployed metadata ecosystems.
- [Metadata Provenance](/features/metadata-provenance/overview) - maintaining the origin of each metadata element.
- [Metadata Security](/features/metadata-security/overview) - ensuring metadata elements are only visible to/editable by the appropriate consumers.
- [Open Type System](/features/open-type-system/overview) - managing your own open metadata types.
- [People, Roles and Organizations](/features/people-roles-organizations/overview) - how to synchronize information about people, what they do and how they are organized with Egeria to support security, collaboration, escalations and delegations.
- [Reference Data Management](/features/reference-data-management/overview) - how to synchronize code values and other types of reference data across your systems.
- [Synchronized Access Control](/features/synchronized-access-control/overview) - how to use metadata to maintain security information used to secure access to [digital resources](/concepts/resource).
- [Templated Cataloguing](/features/templated-cataloguing/overview) - using existing metadata elements as templates when cataloguing new [resources](/concepts/resource).
- [User Feedback](/features/user-feedback/overview) - opening up the communication between [resource](/concepts/resource) owners and resource consumers.
