# 0580 Data Dictionaries

At the start of a data project, it is often necessary to describe the types of data that is needed.  This is called a data specification.  
*DataField* entities are used to model specific data fields required by the data project.  As the project progresses, [data schemas](/tpyes/5/0505-Schema-Attributes) are defined to describe how data is organized in the different data assets used by the project.

The data dictionary maintains lists of pre-defined, reusable data fields.
