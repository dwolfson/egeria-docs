# 0422 Governed Data Classifications

Governed Data Classifications describe the common (ie typical) types of classifications
that are used in the governance controls for the data governance domain.

* *Impact* describes the impact of a situation on a particular resource.
* *Criticality* describes how critical a resource is to the operations of the organization.
* *Confidentiality* typically is used with a data resource and indicates how confidential its content is.
* *Confidence* indicates how confident the organization in the use of this resource in terms of its quality.
* *Retention* defines how long a resource (typically a data resource) needs to be kept.
