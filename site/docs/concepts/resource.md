# Resource

The term *resource* is used throughout the Egeria documentation to refer to something - either physical or digital - that is of value to the operation of the organization, or to the services it provides.

Resources are described in metadata as [Assets](/concepts/asset).

In addition, the organization may [capture intellectual property](/patterns/metadata-manager/overview) in metadata as, for example, a [glossary term](/principles/common-data-definitions/anatomy-of-a-glossary/#inside-a-glossary-term) or a [governance definition](/services/omas/governance-program/overview).
