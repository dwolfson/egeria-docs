# Data Dictionary

A *Data Dictionary* is an organized and curated collection of data definitions that can serve as a reference for data professionals.  

Data dictionaries can be used for many different purposes. For example, a data dictionary may describe the data fields found in a particular data store; another may define the typical data fields found in a subject area.

Data dictionaries may be used as information sources, or as a collection of templates to use when defining new [Data Specifications](/concepts/data-specification).
