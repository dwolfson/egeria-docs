# Data Structure

A *Data Structure* is part of a [data specification](/concepts/data-specification) that describes how a data source should be structured. 

Each data structure consists of an ordered list of [data fields](/concepts/data-field) that describe the logical type of each required data item.  The ordering identifies the order they should be implemented in the resulting data source.  It is also possible to specify whether a data field is optional, or whether there may be multiple instances of it.



???+ info "Additional information"
    * The open metadata types for a data structure and its data fields are found in [Model 0580 Data Dictionaries](/types/5/0580-Data-Dictionaries/).
    * [Data Designer OMVS](/services/omvs/data-designer/overview) provides the API for creating data specifications.
