# Process

A *process* describes a well-defined set of processing steps and decisions that drive a particular aspect of the organization's business. Most processes are automated with software, but they may also be a manual procedure. An automated process can be invoked from a remote server through an API.

A process is a type of [asset](/concepts/asset).  Egeria uses [Governance Action Processes](/concepts/governance-action-process) to automate governance.
