# Apache Kafka Content Pack

The *ApacheKafkaContentPack* contains the connector definitions for the Apache Kafka connectors and governance services supplied in the *omag-server-platform* distribution along with the valid metadata values for the technologies they support. This content pack is designed to provide a good starting point for connecting Egeria to Apache Kafka in order ti access its metadata.


This content pack is built by the [core-content-pack](https://github.com/odpi/egeria/tree/main/open-metadata-resources/open-metadata-archives/) module.
