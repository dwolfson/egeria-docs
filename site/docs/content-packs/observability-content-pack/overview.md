# Metadata Observability Content Pack

The *ObservabilityContentPack* contains the connector definitions for the connectors that capture observations about the open metadata ecosystem.  These connectors are supplied in the *omag-server-platform* distribution. This content pack is designed to load a PostgreSQL database with key observations that can be used for building a dashboard.

This content pack is built by the [core-content-pack](https://github.com/odpi/egeria/tree/main/open-metadata-resources/open-metadata-archives/) module.
